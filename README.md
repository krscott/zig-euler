# zig-euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) exercises solved with [Zig](https://ziglang.org/).

## Usage

Run an individual solution number N (as in `euler-N.zig`) with `zig build N`.

Run tests for all solutions with `zig build test`

## Disclaimer

This is me learning Zig and experimenting with its features. These solutions are probably
not anywhere near minimal, nor "production-ready". Caveat lector.
